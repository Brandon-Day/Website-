<h1>We first looked at the temperature graph and saw that it was constant and had a higher slope later on in the graph. We paired that with either the Rocky Mountains or Desert Plains because they have a constant temperature with a quick rise in temperature in the afternoon. The light graph is wavering and has small dips which could represent the occasional clouds that the Rocky Mountains have. In addition, the low howls of the wind could be why the sound goes into the negatives. The constant line of the graph of Movement varies with intensity as it wavers slightly.   <h1>
